# Building historical index constituents
### Author: Haykaz Aramyan

## Overview
In this article, we explore the process of building historical constituents of a market index, underscoring its importance for investors, researchers, and various participants in the financial markets.

While identifying the current members of an index is straightforward, uncovering this information for previous periods sometimes presents significant challenges. Indexes are subject to frequent changes due to regular rebalancing, mergers, acquisitions, and delistings. Thus, those interested in historical data must navigate these changes to maintain the accuracy of their analyses. LSEG provides access to historical index constituents through its APIs, yet there isn't a simple, single AI call to retrieve the constituents historically. Users faced with the task either call the index constituent function multiple times in a loop (which results numerous API calls and is not a suugested workflow) or have to reconstruct the constituent lists manually based on the response received from the Joiner/Leaver capabilities of the API.

This article aims to streamline this process. We introduce a series of functions designed to simplify access to historical index data, allowing users to retrieve this information through a single API request. In addition to the series of functions we explore in the article, we have encapsulated them within a singleton Python object, offering a unified interface for their invocation. This object is accessible in this repo.
